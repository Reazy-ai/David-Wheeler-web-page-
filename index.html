        <p>
          My professional interests focus on computer security (especially in
          <a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs"
            >developing secure software</a
          >), Free/libre/open source software (FLOSS or OSS), improving software
          development practices, and open standards. I am the Director of Open
          Source Supply Chain Security at the Linux Foundation (LF) and an
          adjunct professor in the George Mason University (GMU) Department of
          Computer Science.

      Most of my written work is not publicly available (e.g., I've done some
      work in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as more
      about secure software, that I do not have the right to post). However, if
      I am allowed to make it publicly available, I try to host it on
      <a href="https://dwheeler.com/">my website</a>, or at least include a
      reference to it from my website. Here are some of my publicly-available

    <h4>Hobbies/Personal Info</h4>
    <p>
      My hobbies include tabletop role-playing games (mostly D&D), chess,
      singing (bass), and reading (especially science fiction and fact). I also
      play the piano, guitar, tuba, and baritone horn, though never at the same
      time. I live in Northern Virginia, near Washington, DC. I'm a Christian;
      <a href="https://dwheeler.com/xian.html"
        >more information about Christianity is available.</a
      >
    </p>
    <h4>Other Stuff</h4>
    <p>
      In the mid-1980s I was the maintainer of
      <a href="https://dwheeler.com/scepter-of-goth/scepter-of-goth.html"
        >Scepter of Goth.</a
      >
      This was the first commercial multiplayer Role-Playing Game (RPG) in the
      United States; I think it was the first in the world, though that depends
      on how you date the commercialization of Scepter and of Bartle's MUD /
      British Legends. This was before Internet access was widespread; Scepter
      was a franchise operation, with each franchise running in a local area
      (customers would dial into a local franchise). Scepter has influenced many
      later systems, including many of the multi-million-dollar Massively
      Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPGs) of today. I haven't been in
      that business for many years, but people still remember me for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years I worked at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA); I
      started as a consultant in 1987, becamae a research staff member (RSM) not
      long afterwards, and ended my full-time employment there on 2020-03-31.
    </p>
    <h4>Why the middle initial ("A.")?</h4>
    <p>
      I always use my middle initial in anything written (including information
      on the web), because there are a number of other David Wheelers. For
      example, David John Wheeler (now deceased) was the creator of the
      <a href="http://www.simonshepherd.supanet.com/tea.htm"
        >Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)</a
      >
      (a somewhat popular encryption algorithm unencumbered by patents), and is
      credited with co-inventing the subroutine. David E. Wheeler is President
      of Kineticode, a content management and software development consulting
      company based in Portland, and is the lead developer for Bricolage (an
      OSS/FS content management system); you can contact him using the address
      "david" at justatheory dot com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: the Associated Press (AP) Style guide recommends that you include my
      middle initial in this case. The
      <a
        href="http://htn.readmedia.com/training-calendar/quick-video-clips/associated-press-style-guide#:~:text=Use%20middle%20initials%20in%20full,the%20person%20uses%20it%20regularly."
        >AP Style guide says to "use middle initials in full name reference only
        if the person uses it regularly"</a
      >
      - and I do use my middle initial regularly.
